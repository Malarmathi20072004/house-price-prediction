# house-price-prediction

Welcome to our House Price Prediction Project, where we embark on a journey through real estate and data analysis. The value of a home is influenced by an array of factors, both internal and external. Our project seeks to combine the realms of data science and housing markets to create a predictive model that can estimate property prices with accuracy. By considering variables such as location, property features, economic indicators, and market trends, we aim to equip homebuyers, sellers, and investors with a tool that provides valuable insights. Join us as we explore the intricate world of real estate data to make more informed decisions in the dynamic realm of property transactions.
